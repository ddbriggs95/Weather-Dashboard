# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This project tasked me with creating a weather dashboard utilizing the OpenWeather API. This site allows you to see a 5 day forecast of weather in a city based off user search input.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
- WHEN I search for a city
- THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- WHEN I click on a city in the search history
- THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
